# React + Vite

# Event Calendar
An interactive Event Calendar application built from scratch without relying on any external libraries for calendar functionality. All the calendar logic has been implemented manually, ensuring a deep understanding of how a calendar works.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


# Features
Custom Calendar Logic:
The entire calendar was developed from the ground up, including date calculations, day-of-week alignment, and month transitions. No external libraries were used.

Add Events to Specific Dates:
Users can add custom events to any specific date.

View Events:
A sidebar displays events for the selected date, providing a clean and intuitive way to manage and view scheduled activities.


# Command to run the code
